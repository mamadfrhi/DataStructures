## Definition
Making blocks in the memory and connect them to each other!

Each block has 2 parts:
1.  value
2. Address to the next block

### Pros➕
1. It doesn't take much memory like *Arrays*

### Cons➕
1. Access, remove and add elements are time-consuming
   * Because it need to traverse whole of the list from the head (worst case) to find specific element to do the command!
